# SIMPLE 2D CAD SOFTWARE
### Team Pixor

**** This project aims to bring the power and precision of CAD to a wider audience, making it accessible and easy to use for everyone. Our software will be designed with simplicity and user- friendliness in mind, ensuring that even those with minimal technical knowledge can create and manipulate 2D designs with ease. It will include basic features such as drawing lines, circles, rectangles, and other shapes, as well as more advanced functionalities like layer management, dimensioning, and exporting to various file formats. We believe that this project has the potential to revolutionize the way people approach design, by breaking down the barriers of traditional CAD software and making design a more inclusive and accessible field. ****
